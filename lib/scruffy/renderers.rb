# Renderers piece the entire graph together from a collection
# of components.  Creating new renderers allows you to create
# entirely new layouts for your graphs.
#
# Scruffy::Renderers::Base contains the basic functionality needed
# by a layout.  The easiest way to create a new layout is by subclassing
# Base.
